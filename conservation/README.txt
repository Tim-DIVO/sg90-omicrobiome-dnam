This was an attempt at annotating CpG sites with evolutionary conservation scores based on Ensembl data.

None of this was used in the final manuscript, however, it might prove useful for further CpG site filtering that is not based on aging clocks.

CpG locations have been retrieved from infinium-methylationepic-v-1-0-b5-manifest-file.csv, which can be found here: https://sapac.support.illumina.com/downloads/infinium-methylationepic-v1-0-product-files.html
