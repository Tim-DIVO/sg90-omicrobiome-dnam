Since biological data collection was not done on the same date as SG90 metadata collection, interaction tests were conducted to evaluate significance of time difference using various OLS models:

1. On subset that contains dates of data collection
2. On all, with missing time difference imputed by MICE
3. On all, with missing time difference imputed for min-/max-sensitivity analysis

Results can be seen in "Confounders" and "Phenotypes", respectively.
